# computer-graphics-THREEjs

A collection of my computer graphics examples using THREEjs.

## The purpose of this repository

During my studies I had to use THREEjs as a tool to create different projects regarding computer graphics. I realized
that I would like to share my experience with this way of using computer graphics. All can be used regarding the LICENSE
and is purely intended as learning material.

## The structure of this repository

THREEjs is a rapidly changing JS library, and it tends to go through __major__ changes in some version increments, so I
decided to explicitly put a copy of version *r132* as a static dependency, thus preventing possible breaks. This means
that connecting this project with other `npm` managed projects might be a bit of a hassle. If you would like to do that,
I recommend modifying the inline scripts. To use a module managed by `npm`, it really is a nobrainer.

### Considerations regarding the scripts

The only purpose of this repository is to represent some computer graphics fundamentals and ideas in an easily and
universally accessible and hackable manner. This is the reason for me putting scripts inline `HTML5` documents.
